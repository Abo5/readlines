# Readlines Library

Readlines is a powerful and versatile Ruby library for file manipulation and processing. It provides a wide range of functionality to read, analyze, and modify the contents of text files efficiently.

## Features

- **File Reading**: Read the entire file content or specific parts.
- **Search Operations**: Search for values and display matching line numbers.
- **Line Counting**: Count lines based on keywords or delimiters.
- **Pattern Replacement**: Replace specific patterns or multiple patterns at once.
- **Delete Empty Lines**: Remove empty lines.
- **Alphabetical Sorting**: Sort lines alphabetically.
- **File Splitting**: Split files into parts or by size.
- **File Merging**: Merge multiple files with a separator.
- **Encoding Conversion**: Convert file encoding.
- **Character Replacement**: Replace special characters or unwanted characters.
- **Format Conversion**: Convert the file to txt, csv, or json.
- **Multiple Pattern Search**: Search and count multiple patterns.
- **Delimiter-Based Splitting**: Split files by delimiter or pattern.
- **Pattern Checking**: Check if patterns exist.
- **Delete Specific Lines**: Delete lines, specific columns in CSV, and duplicates.
- **Reverse Content**: Reverse the fileâ€™s content.
- **Range-Based Search**: Search within a specific line range.
- **Character and Word Counting**: Count characters or words.
- **Pattern Extraction**: Extract specific patterns.
- **Content Validation**: Validate against custom rules.
- **Logical Pattern Search**: AND/OR based pattern search.
- **Spelling Check**: Detect spelling errors with a dictionary.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt content.
- **File Size Calculation**: Display size in bytes, KB, MB, or GB.
- **Filter Operation**: Delete or replace lines based on matching criteria (`:start`, `:body`, or `:end`).

## Installation

To use the Readlines library in your Ruby project, install it via RubyGems:

```bash
gem install readlines
```

Or add it to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'readlines'
```

Run `bundle install` to install the library and its dependencies.

## Usage

Start by requiring `readlines` in your Ruby script:

```ruby
require 'readlines/read'
```

Create an instance of the `Readlines::ReadDuc` class with the filename (or full path):

```ruby
file_name = 'file.txt'
read = Readlines::ReadDuc.new(file_name)
```

### Examples

#### Search for a specific word and count occurrences

```ruby
# Search for the word "example" in the file
read = Readlines::ReadDuc.new('data.txt')
results = read.search_about('example', show_lines: true)

# Display the number of occurrences
puts "Number of occurrences: #{results.count}"
```

#### Basic Operations

```ruby
# Read the entire file content
content = read.read_lines
puts content
```

#### Counting Operations

```ruby
# Count characters in the file or a specific line
total_characters = read.character_count
puts total_characters
line_characters = read.character_count(line_specific: 3)
puts line_characters

# Count words in the file or a specific line
total_words = read.word_count
puts total_words
line_words = read.word_count(line_specific: 3)
puts line_words
```

#### Replacement Operations

```ruby
# Replace specific patterns in the file
updated_content = read.replace(/example/, 'new_example')
puts updated_content

# Replace multiple patterns at once
pattern_replacement = {/example/ => 'new_example', /test/ => 'new_test'}
updated_content = read.replace_multiple_patterns(pattern_replacement)
puts updated_content

# Replace characters in a CSV column
updated_csv = read.replace_csv_value(2, 'old_value', 'new_value')
puts updated_csv

# Replace special characters with a specified replacement string
updated_content = read.replace_special_characters('_')
puts updated_content
```

#### Deletion Operations

```ruby
# Delete empty lines from the file
updated_content = read.delete_empty_lines
puts updated_content

# Delete specific lines with the option to remove empty lines
updated_content = read.delete_lines([2, 4, 6], delete_space: true)
puts updated_content

# Delete unwanted characters
updated_content = read.delete_unwanted_characters('!@#$%^')
puts updated_content

# Delete duplicate lines
unique_content = read.delete_duplicate_lines
puts unique_content

# Delete specific columns in a CSV file
updated_csv = read.delete_csv_columns([1, 3])
puts updated_csv
```

#### File Splitting and Merging

```ruby
# Split the file into 3 parts
read.split_file(3)

# Split by size (in bytes)
read.split_file_by_size(1024) # 1 KB

# Split by delimiter
read.split_by_delimiter('---')

# Split by a pattern
read.split_by_pattern(/Chapter \d+/)

# Merge multiple files
merged_file = read.merge_files(['/path/to/file1.txt', '/path/to/file2.txt'])
puts merged_file

# Merge files with a separator
merged_file_with_separator = read.merge_files(['/file1.txt', '/file2.txt'], separator: '---')
puts merged_file_with_separator
```

#### Encoding and Format Conversion

```ruby
# Convert encoding
read.convert_encoding('UTF-8', 'ISO-8859-1')

# Convert file format to CSV
converted_csv = read.convert_to_format('csv')
puts converted_csv
```

#### Error Handling

The Readlines library provides custom error classes for handling specific exceptions:

- **Readlines::Error**: General error class for all exceptions.
- **Readlines::NotFoundError**: Raised when the file is not found.
- **Readlines::MissingFilePathError**: Raised when a file path is missing or empty.
- **Readlines::InvalidUnitError**: Raised for invalid file size units.

These error classes help in handling and debugging exceptions that may occur while using the library.
